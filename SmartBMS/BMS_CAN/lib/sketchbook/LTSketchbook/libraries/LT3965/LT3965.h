LT3965 - Octal Matrix LED Bypass Switch

@verbatim

The LT3965 is an LED bypass switching device for dimming indiviadual LEDs in a
string using a common current source. It features eight individually controlled
floating source N-channel MOSFET switches rated for 17V/330 mÎ©. The eight
switches can be connected in parallel and/or in series to bypass current around
one or more LEDs in a string. The LT3965 as a slave uses the I2C serial interface
to communicate with the master. Each of eight channels can be independently
programmed to bypass the LED string in constant on, constant off, dimming without
fade transition or dimming with fade transition mode.
