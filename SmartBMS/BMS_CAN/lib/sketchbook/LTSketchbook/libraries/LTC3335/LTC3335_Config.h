LTC3335: Nanopower Buck-Boost DC/DC with Integrated Coulomb Counter

This header file contains the definitions that allow configuration
of the LTC3335 driver.  The definitions belong to two groups:

  1. The first set of definitions configure the driver for the
     IPEAK, VOUT, and battery capacity for the application.  Advanced
     features such as a battery current measurement and software correction
     can also be enabled.

  2. The LTC3335 driver was written so that no hardware references are made
     in the .cpp file.  Instead, this file records what links to hardware
     functions must be defined for the LTC3335 driver to operate.  Change
     these definitions to configure the LTC3335.c driver for a microprocessor
     other than the Linduino.

@verbatim
The LTCÂ®3335 is a high efficiency, low quiescent current
(680nA) buck-boost DC/DC converter with an integrated
precision coulomb counter which monitors accumulated
battery discharge in long life battery powered applications.
The buck-boost can operate down to 1.8V on its input and
provides eight pin-selectable output voltages with up to
50mA of output current.

The coulomb counter stores the accumulated battery discharge
in an internal register accessible via an I2C interface.
The LTC3335 features a programmable discharge alarm
threshold. When the threshold is reached, an interrupt is
generated at the IRQ pin.

To accommodate a wide range of battery types and sizes,
the peak input current can be selected from as low as 5mA
to as high as 250mA and the full-scale coulomb counter
has a programmable range of 32,768:1.
