LTC2600: Octal 16-Bit Rail-to-Rail DACs in 16-Lead SSOP

@verbatim

The LTC2600/LTC2610/LTC2620 are octal 16-, 14- and 12-bit, 2.5V-to-5.5V
rail-to-rail voltage-output DACs in 16-lead narrow SSOP and 20-lead 4mm Ã— 5mm
QFN packages. They have built-in high performance output buffers and are
guaranteed monotonic.

These parts establish advanced performance standards for output drive,
crosstalk and load regulation in single-supply, voltage output multiples.

Cx   : DAC Command Code
Ax   : DAC Address (0=DACA, 1=DACB, 2=DACC, 3=DACD, 0xFF=All DACs)
Dx   : DAC Data Bits
X    : Don't care


Example Code:

Set DAC A to to 2V for 16-bit DAC.

    shift_count = 0;    // 16-bit DAC does not have to be shifted
    dac_voltage = 2.0;  // Sets dac voltage variable to 2v

    dac_code = LTC2600_voltage_to_code(dac_voltage, LTC2600_lsb, LTC2600_offset);       // Calculate DAC code from voltage, lsb, and offset
    LTC2600_write(LTC2600_CS, LTC2600_CMD_WRITE_UPDATE, LTC2600_DAC_A, dac_code << shift_count);    // Set DAC A with DAC code
