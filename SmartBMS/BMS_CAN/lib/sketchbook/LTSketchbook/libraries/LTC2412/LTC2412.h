LTC2412: 2-Channel Differential Input 24-Bit No Latency Delta Sigma ADC
LTC2413: 24-Bit No Latency Delta Sigma ADC with Simultaneous 50Hz/60Hz Rejection ADC

@verbatim

The LTC2412 is a 2-channel differential input micropower 24-bit No Latency
Delta-Sigma analog-to-digital converter with an integrated oscillator. It
provides 2ppm INL and 0.16ppm RMS noise over the entire supply range. The two
differential channels are converted alternately with channel ID included in
the conversion results.

The converter accepts any external differential reference voltage from 0.1V to
VCC for flexible ratiometric and remote sensingmeasurement configurations. The
full-scale differential input range is from â€“0.5VREF to 0.5VREF. The LTC2412
communicates through a flexible 3-wire digital interface which is compatible
with SPI and MICROWIRE protocols.

SPI DATA FORMAT (MSB First):

            Byte #1                            Byte #2                           Byte #3                    Byte #4

Data Out :  !EOC CH SIG  D23 D22 D21 D20 D19   D18 D17 D16 D15 D14 D13 D12 D11   D10 D9 D8 D7 D6 D5 D4 D3   D2 D1 D0  X  X  X  X  X

!EOC : End of Conversion Bit (Active Low)
CH   : Channel selected
SIG  : Sign Bit (1-data positive, 0-data negative)
Dx   : Data Bits


Example Code:

Read Channel 0 in Single-Ended mode

    uint16_t miso_timeout = 1000;

    if(LTC2412_EOC_timeout(LTC2412_CS, miso_timeout))    // Check for EOC
        return(1);
    LTC2412_read(LTC2412_CS, &adc_code);   // Obtains the current reading and stores to adc_code variable

    // Convert adc_code to voltage
    adc_voltage = LTC2412_code_to_voltage(adc_code, LTC2412_lsb , LTC2412_offset_code);
