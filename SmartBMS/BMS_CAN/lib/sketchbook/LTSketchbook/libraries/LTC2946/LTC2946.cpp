LTC2946: 12-Bit Wide Range Power, Charge and Energy Monitor

@verbatim

The LTC®2946 is a rail-to-rail system monitor that measures
current, voltage, power, charge and energy. It features an
operating range of 2.7V to 100V and includes a shunt regulator
for supplies above 100V. The current measurement common mode
range of 0V to 100V is independent of the input supply.
A 12-bit ADC measures load current, input voltage and an
auxiliary external voltage. Load current and internally
calculated power are integrated over an external clock or
crystal or internal oscillator time base for charge and energy.
An accurate time base allows the LTC2946 to provide measurement
accuracy of better than ±0.6% for charge and ±1% for power and
energy. Minimum and maximum values are stored and an overrange
alert with programmable thresholds minimizes the need for software
polling. Data is reported via a standard I2C interface.
Shutdown mode reduces power consumption to 15uA.
