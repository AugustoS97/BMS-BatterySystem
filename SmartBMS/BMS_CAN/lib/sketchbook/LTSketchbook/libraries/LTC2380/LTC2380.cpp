The following parts (DUT) are pin-compatible, 16/18/20-bit A/D converters with serial I/O, and an internal reference:
LTC2376-16: 16-Bit, 250Ksps ADC
LTC2376-18: 18-Bit, 250Ksps ADC
LTC2376-20: 20-Bit, 250Ksps ADC
LTC2377-16: 16-Bit, 500Ksps ADC
LTC2377-18: 18-Bit, 500Ksps ADC
LTC2377-20: 20-Bit, 500Ksps ADC
LTC2378-16: 16-Bit, 1Msps ADC
LTC2378-18: 18-Bit, 1Msps ADC
LTC2378-20: 20-Bit, 1Msps ADC
LTC2379-18: 18-Bit, 1.6Msps ADC
LTC2380-16: 16-Bit, 2Msps ADC

The DUTs typically draw only 8.4 mA from a single 2.5V supply. The automatic nap and sleep modes benefit power sensitive applications.

The DUTs DC performance is outstanding with a +/-0.5 ppm INL specification and
no missing codes over temperature. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the LTC2380 is typically 104 dB, with the internal reference.
