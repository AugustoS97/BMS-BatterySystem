LTC2656: Octal SPI 16-/12-Bit Rail-to-Rail DACs with 10ppm/C Max Reference

@verbatim

The LTC2656 is a family of octal 16-/12-bit rail-to-rail DACs with a precision
integrated reference. The DACs have built-in high performance, rail-to-rail,
output buffers and are guaranteed monotonic. The LTC2656-L has a full-scale
output of 2.5V with the integrated 10ppm/C reference and operates from a single
2.7V to 5.5V supply. The LTC2656-H has a full-scale output of 4.096V with the
integrated reference and operates from a 4.5V to 5.5V supply. Each DAC can also
operate with an external reference, which sets the DAC full-scale output to two
times the external reference voltage.

These DACs communicate via a SPI/MICROWIRE compatible 4-wire serial interface
which operates at clock rates up to 50MHz. The LTC2656 incorporates a power-on
reset circuit that is controlled by the PORSEL pin. If PORSEL is tied to GND the
DACs reset to zero-scale. If PORSEL is tied to VCC, the DACs reset to mid-scale.

Cx   : DAC Command Code

Example Code:

Set DAC A to to 2V for 16-bit DAC.

    shift_count = 0;    // 16-bit DAC does not have to be shifted
    dac_voltage = 2.0;  // Sets dac voltage variable to 2v

    dac_code = LTC2656_voltage_to_code(dac_voltage, LTC2656_lsb, LTC2656_offset);       // Calculate DAC code from voltage, lsb, and offset
    LTC2656_write(LTC2656_CS, LTC2656_CMD_WRITE_UPDATE, LTC2656_DAC_A, dac_code << shift_count);    // Set DAC A with DAC code
