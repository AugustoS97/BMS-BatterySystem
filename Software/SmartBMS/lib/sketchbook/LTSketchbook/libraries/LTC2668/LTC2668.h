LTC2668: 16-Channel SPI 16-/12-Bit +/-10V Vout SoftSpan DACs with 10ppm/C Max Reference.

@verbatim

The LTC2668 is a family of 16-channel, 12/16-bit +/-10V digital-to-analog converters with integrated
precision references. They are guaranteed monotonic and have built-in rail-to-rail output buffers.
These SoftSpan DACs offer five output ranges up to +/-10V. The range of each channel is independently
programmable, or the part can be hardware-configured for operation in a fixed range.

The integrated 2.5V reference is buffered separately to each channel; an external reference can be used
for additional range options. The LTC2668 also includes toggle capability - alternating codes via the
software toggle command, or by providing a free-running clock to the TGP pin.

The SPI/Microwire-compatible 3-wire serial interface operates on logic levels as low as 1.71V, at clock
rates up to 50MHz.
