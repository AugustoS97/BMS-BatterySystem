LTC2412: 2-Channel Differential Input 24-Bit No Latency Delta Sigma ADC
LTC2413: 24-Bit No Latency Delta Sigma ADC with Simultaneous 50Hz/60Hz Rejection ADC

@verbatim

The LTC2412 is a 2-channel differential input micropower 24-bit No Latency
Delta-Sigma analog-to-digital converter with an integrated oscillator. It
provides 2ppm INL and 0.16ppm RMS noise over the entire supply range. The two
differential channels are converted alternately with channel ID included in
the conversion results.

The converter accepts any external differential reference voltage from 0.1V to
VCC for flexible ratiometric and remote sensingmeasurement configurations. The
full-scale differential input range is from â€“0.5VREF to 0.5VREF. The LTC2412
communicates through a flexible 3-wire digital interface which is compatible
with SPI and MICROWIRE protocols.
